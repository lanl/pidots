First Pidosits code.
Two-dimensional case

Features that are the main changes from ahotn-2d-full

1. No CGSOLVE solution option
2. The new PSDS routine divides up the parallel work
3. The new IDOMATS routine replaces the IDOT routine to control operator construction
4. The IDOT routine now handles the ITMM solution steps: update phi/psi between PBJ iterations
5. PBJ routine handles the communications between the PBJ iterations
6. PROCGRID sets up the 2D mesh processor topology
7. BNC function attempts to evenly divide the number of cells per sub-domain
8. Input has additional line for number of processors
9. Input removes quadrant fluxes input line and matrix printing line
10. Final input line for CG/Direct solution removed: only direct solution here, only asymmetric matrices
