New code: 1D Anisotropic Scattering Code
v2.9.11-DD-1D-AnisotropicScattering

Take 3D Diamond difference code and reduced it to 1D
1. Remove all references to multi-dimensions
2. Rewrote equations that account for infinite medium in y and z
3. Corrected the input reading and the communication structure

Add to 1D slab code the Anisotropic Scattering
1. Read in scattering cross sections for increasing moments
2. SI algorithm same with sweep except now must solve for multiple angular moments
3. Do this by solving for angular flux, then using Legendre polynomial and quadrature
    compute the flux angular moments to be used as scattering source for next iteration.
4. In ITMM, must have a Gamma matrix that has the number of columns dependent on the highest
    order of the scattering term expansion.
5. Include these terms in the Gamma matrix expression.
6. Compute the operators so that they are ordered by cell and angular moment.
