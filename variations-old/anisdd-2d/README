New code: 2D Anisotropic Scattering Code
v2.9.11-DD-2D-AnisotropicScattering

Take 3D Diamond difference code and reduced it to 2D
1. Remove all references to z-dimension
2. Rewrote equations that account for infinite medium in z
3. Corrected the input reading and the communication structure

Add to 2D plane code the Anisotropic Scattering
1. Read in scattering cross sections for increasing moments
2. Read in mu and eta direction cosines. Compute omega, the azimuthal angle.
3. SI algorithm same with sweep except now must solve for multiple angular moments
4. Do this by solving for angular flux, then using spherical harmonics and quadrature
    compute the flux angular moments to be used as scattering source for next iteration.
5. In ITMM, must have a Gamma matrix that has the number of columns dependent on the highest
    order of the scattering term expansion.
6. Include these terms in the Gamma matrix expression.
7. Compute the operators so that they are ordered by cell and angular moment.
8. Spherical harmonics range from l = 0 to L, m = 0 to l
9. Use two new subroutines to compute the Ylm spherical harmonics: legpoly, which finds the m=0
    Legendre polynomials and aslegf, which computes the m>0 associated Legendre functions.
10. Split CONK into CONK and CONKT, that account for the different array dimensions 
     depending on whether or not the transpose flag is turned on.
